# Heart-Disease-Prediction


A machine learning project focused on predicting the presence of heart disease using patient data. The project covers:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Summary statistics, distribution plots  
   - Correlation heatmap to visualize relationships between features

2. **Outlier Analysis**  
   - Identification and removal (or capping) of extreme values in features like cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.

3. **Modeling**  
   - Training a `RandomForestClassifier` 
   - Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, ROC AUC, precision/recall, and confusion matrix
